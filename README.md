Features so far:  
1)Dynamically allocating the memory using alloc functions in C for the storage of the user inputted text.  
2)Ability to remove text when clicking the backspace key.  

Future plans:  
1)Making the window size of the GUI user controllable.  
2)Improving the UI.  
3)Decreasing the allocated memory size when the text is removed.
